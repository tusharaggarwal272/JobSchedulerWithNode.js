Good Day 
Respected Sir/Ma'am

Here I am briefing about how i have made this project using Node.js and using the npm package node-scheduler to schedule the jobs.
Firtly my starting file is App.js which starts from the npm start command (in the scripts already defined with the start).
In this file i have exported the module from index.js in which we are looping all the required events from the list
using the map in javascript.
while iterating them i have scheduled the job on each of them which will be dealayed/setTimeout for the length of the string seconds.

Thankyou.
